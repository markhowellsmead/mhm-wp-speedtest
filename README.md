#AJAX network speed tester

##Description
A WordPress extension which logs the response speed of a regular HTTP request for a static file. The request happens via asynchronous AJAX (JavaScript) and so does not block loading of the page.

##Usage
Just install the plugin. This will then add a JavaScript file reference to the footer of every page. jQuery is not required.

The log file is written to wp-content/uploads/mhm-wp-speedtest with a new subfolder each day and a new file per hour.

Browser support: IE8+ and all modern browsers.
